🔑 Key Node.js Features in Real-World MNC Projects

1. Asynchronous & Non-Blocking I/O
    Event-driven, non-blocking architecture allows handling thousands of requests simultaneously.
    Used in APIs, microservices, chat systems, notification services.

2. Single-Threaded Event Loop with Worker Threads
    Handles high concurrency efficiently on a single thread.
    Worker Threads are used for CPU-intensive tasks (e.g., image processing, ML inference).

3. Microservices Architecture
    Express.js, Fastify → REST APIs
    gRPC, NestJS → structured microservices
    MNCs split applications into independent services for scalability & maintainability.

4. Package Ecosystem (npm/yarn/pnpm)
    Rich ecosystem of libraries for authentication, database drivers, logging, testing, etc.
    Companies prefer pnpm or yarn workspaces for monorepos.

5. API Development & Integration    
    Building RESTful APIs and GraphQL APIs.
    Integrates with gRPC, SOAP services, external APIs, and legacy systems.

6. Scalability with Clustering & Load Balancing
    Node.js Cluster module + PM2 or Docker/Kubernetes for horizontal scaling.
    Used in production to handle millions of requests.

7. Streaming & Real-Time Communication
    WebSockets (Socket.io, ws) → chats, notifications, collaborative apps
    Streams API → large file handling, ETL pipelines, real-time analytics

8. Security Practices
    Helmet.js, CORS, JWT, OAuth2, CSRF protection
    Secrets management via Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Kubernetes Secrets
    Input validation with Joi / Zod

9. Logging & Monitoring
    Winston, Pino, Morgan for structured logging.
    Integrated with ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Grafana + Loki.
    Metrics exposed via Prometheus exporters.

10. Error Handling & Resilience
      Global error handling with middleware
      Circuit breakers & retries with resilience libraries
      Graceful shutdown for Kubernetes/Docker deployments

11. Database Integrations
      SQL: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL with Sequelize, Prisma, Knex
      NoSQL: MongoDB, Redis, DynamoDB
      Connection pooling & caching for high performance

12. Message Queues & Event-Driven Systems
      KafkaJS, RabbitMQ, BullMQ (Redis) for async jobs.
      Used for background jobs like email, push notifications, data sync.

13. Testing & Quality Assurance
      Jest, Mocha, Chai, Supertest → unit & integration tests.
      Contract testing with Pact in microservices.
      CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI.

14. TypeScript Adoption
      Node.js + TypeScript preferred in MNCs for type safety & maintainability.
      Helps with large codebases, API contracts, and reducing runtime errors.

15. DevOps & Cloud Integration
      Dockerized Node.js apps deployed on Kubernetes / AWS ECS / GCP Cloud Run.
      Config management with 12-factor app principles.
      Infra as Code with Terraform + Ansible.

16. Performance Optimizations
      Caching with Redis / CDN
      Profiling with clinic.js, flamegraphs, node --inspect
      Load testing with k6, Artillery

17. Serverless Architectures
      Node.js functions deployed on AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, GCP Cloud Functions.
      Used for event-driven systems, data pipelines, and lightweight APIs.

18. Edge Computing & Edge Functions
      Node.js (or Deno/Cloudflare Workers) for low-latency APIs at the edge.
      Used for CDN-backed personalization or real-time analytics.

19. Internationalization (i18n) & Localization
      Libraries like i18next, Globalize.
      Handles time zones, currencies, translations, number/date formatting.

20. API Gateway & Rate Limiting
      Middleware + Nginx/Kong/Apigee for API Gateway
      Features: throttling, caching, authentication, request shaping
      Libraries: express-rate-limit, rate-limiter-flexible

21. Configuration Management
      Feature flags (LaunchDarkly/Unleash).
      dotenv / config npm package for environment configs.
      Secrets stored in Vault / AWS Secrets Manager.

22. CI/CD & Release Strategies
      Blue-Green & Canary deployments for microservices.
      Feature toggles + A/B testing.
      Automated rollback with monitoring hooks.

23. Compliance & Observability
      Logging & monitoring tied with GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2
      Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry + Jaeger/Zipkin
      Correlation IDs for debugging across services

24. Hybrid Apps & APIs for Mobile
      Node.js as Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) for React Native / Flutter apps.
      Aggregation layer to optimize mobile API calls.

25. AI/ML Integrations
      Integration with Python ML models (via gRPC/REST)
      TensorFlow.js for light ML inference
      External APIs (OpenAI, AWS Sagemaker)

26. Container Security & Best Practices
      Scanning with Trivy, Snyk
      Runtime security with Falco, OPA (Open Policy Agent)

27. Polyglot & Interoperability
      Node.js coexists with Java, Go, Python services in MNC projects.
      Communication via gRPC, Kafka, REST, GraphQL.

28. Data Pipelines & ETL
      Node.js Streams + Kafka/RabbitMQ for real-time data pipelines.
      Used in log aggregation, analytics, and ETL jobs.

29. Monorepo Management
      Large-scale apps managed with Nx, Turborepo.
      Supports shared libraries, code reuse, and faster builds.
